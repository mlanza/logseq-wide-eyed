# Logseq Wide Eyed Plugin

Toggle the visibility of completed and canceled to-dos.

Version 2 replaced the guts with the internals of [Style Carousel](https://github.com/mlanza/logseq-style-carousel).  The prior implementation is no longer supported.  The only difference is the icon font set used for the ever-present eye.

This plugin may eventually be deprecated due to the existence of Style Carousel which has the same default behavior.  Furthermore, it can be customized to use the familiar Wide Eyed eye icon.

Additionally, since Style Carousel and Wide Eyed are internally the same, do not install both.  It's one or the other.
