# Logseq Wide Eyed Plugin

Toggle the visibility of completed and canceled to-dos.

Version 2 replaced the guts with the internals of [Style Carousel](https://github.com/mlanza/logseq-style-carousel).  The prior implementation is no longer supported.  The only difference is the icon font set used for the ever-present eye.

This plugin is destined for deprecation due to the existence of Style Carousel.  It will exist for a time to allow users to make the switch.  Style Carousel has the same default behavior.  It can even be customized to use the familiar Wide Eyed eye icon.
