# Logseq Wide Eyed Plugin

Toggle the visibility of completed and canceled to-dos.

Version 2 replaced the guts with the internals of [Style Carousel](https://github.com/mlanza/logseq-style-carousel).  The prior implementation is no longer supported.  The only difference is the icon font set used for the ever-present eye.

Since Style Carousel and Wide Eyed are internally the same, do not install both.  It's one or the other.

This plugin may eventually be deprecated due to the existence of Style Carousel which has the same default behavior.  Furthermore, it [can be customized](https://github.com/mlanza/logseq-style-carousel#using-the-eye-icon-from-wide-eyed) to use the familiar Wide Eyed eye icon.  Please consider making the switch before that happens.
