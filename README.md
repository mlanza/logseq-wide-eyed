# Logseq Wide Eyed Plugin

Toggles the visibility of completed and canceled to-dos.

Version 2 replaced the guts with the internals of [Style Carousel](https://github.com/mlanza/logseq-style-carousel).  The prior implementation is no longer supported.  The only difference in Wide Eyed is the icon font set used for the ever-present eye.
